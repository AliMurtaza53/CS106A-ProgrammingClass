Play WordGuess!
The computer first selects a secret word at random from
a list built into the program. The program then prints out a row of dashesâ€” one for each
letter in the secret word and asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that
is in the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in the correct
positions, along with any letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does not
appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess. The user keeps guessing
letters until either (1) the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word or (2) the
user has made eight incorrect guesses.
